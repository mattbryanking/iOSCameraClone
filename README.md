A native, stripped down version of the iOS 17 camera app built with Swift and XCode, built to explore AVFoundation.

While the original Apple Camera app integrates advanced features like AI image manipulation and Metal graphics rendering, my focus is on creating a simple yet functional user interface that mirrors the style of the iPhone Camera app. 

This app intentionally omits complex features like portrait mode, panoramic images, live images, intelligent lens switching, and f-stop adjustments. Instead, we concentrate on core functionalities:

- Camera Modes - Video, Photo, Burst Mode, Slow Motion, and Timelapse.
- Customizable Settings - Users can adjust the aspect ratio, image quality, and flash mode.
- Interactive Controls - Pinch-to-zoom and tap-to-focus.
